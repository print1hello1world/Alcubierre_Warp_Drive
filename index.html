        The Alcubierre warp drive is a speculative idea based on a solution of <u>Einstein's field equations in general relativity</u>
        as proposed by theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre, by which a spacecraft could achieve <b>apparent faster-than-light travel
        </b> if a configurable energy-density field lower than that of vacuum (that is, negative mass) could be created. 
        <br /><b>Rather than exceeding the speed of light within a local reference frame</b>, a spacecraft would traverse distances by 
        contracting space in front of it and expanding space behind it, resulting in effective faster-than-light travel. <u>Objects
        cannot accelerate to the speed of light within normal spacetime</u>; instead, the Alcubierre drive shifts space around an object
        so that the object would arrive at its destination faster than light would in normal space.
